# 🛠️ Price Prediction Model
## 🚀 Overview:
This project is a Price Prediction Model that allows users to select between different prediction types (e.g., flight, house, etc.) and get accurate price estimates. The model is built using XGBoost and incorporates Explainable AI for better interpretability.

## 🌐 Tech Stack:
- Frontend: Streamlit
- Backend: Node.js (to be added)
- Model: XGBoost with Kaggle dataset
- Explainability: Explainable AI

## 📊 Features:
- Multiple price prediction types (flight, house)
- Interactive UI with Streamlit
- Accurate predictions using XGBoost
- Explainable AI insights

## ⚙️ Installation:
1) Clone the repository:
```
git clone <repository_link>
cd <repository_folder>
```
2) Install dependencies:
```
pip install streamlit xgboost pandas numpy
```
3) Run the frontend
```
streamlit run app.py
```
4) (Backend coming soon with Node.js)

## 📄 Usage:
- Select the prediction type (flight, house)
- Enter the relevant details
- View the predicted price along with model insights

## 💡 Future Improvements:
- Adding a Node.js backend
- Integrating a database for storing predictions
- Enhancing model accuracy and performance
